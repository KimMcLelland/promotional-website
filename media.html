        <h2>My media studies and experience</h2>
        <p>I am educated to Masters level.  My adult education began in 2000 when I studied History and Philosophy at Manchester Metropolitan University and got a 2.1</p>
        <p>But my media studies began years later than that.  I studied BTec Multimedia Design from 2006 to 2008 and learnt many aspects of filming, photography, photoshop and audio and video editing there.</p>
        <p>Following that I studied my Masters in Multimedia Journalism, graduating in 2019.  This involved written journalism but also broadcast journalism, building on those filming and editing skills.  For my disseration I made an audio documentary about Paganism and the LGBT Community.</p>

        <p>I was also very active on YouTube from 2015 to 2020, filming video essays on various topics, which I also edited myself.</p>
