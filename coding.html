        <h2>My coding experience</h2>
        <p>I was interested in coding from a young age, when I first started messing around with Basic on the BBC Micro in the 80s.  I also took a strong liking to the Repton games and the ability to create your own levels and sprites, especially Repton Infinity that was involved a coding language and was like a game engine.</p>
        <p>It took me a long time to take an interest in coding again however.  When studying my Masters in Multimedia Journalism I took a liking to website design and enjoyed learning html and css.</p>
        <p>I then self-taught myself a bit of JavaScript through Codecademy, and finally enrolled on two courses with Code Nation, from which I learnt Python, JavaScript, JS React, JS Node and git.</p>
        <p>Since then I have continued to learn, picking up an interest in PyQt and Django.</p>
        <p>Here is my github with examples of various coding projects: </p>
