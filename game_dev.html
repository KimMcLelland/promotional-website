        <p>I use godot to create  my own 2D video games.</p>
        <p>Inpired by sandbox games like Minecraft and Terraria on the one hand, and RPGs like Skyrim and Baldur's Gate 3 on the other, I have been trying to find creative ways to combine the best of both for a while now.</p>
        <p>My current project is a series of games that feature a parallel world of myths, gods and monsters.  You craft armour and weapons, forage for food and resources, interact with gods to complete quests and fight monsters.</p>
        <p>The game I am currently working on is set in Roman Times and you are an investigator, investigating the disappearance of a community of people, which leads you into a parallel world of Greek gods and goddesses and greek mythical creatures.  You must complete a series of quests for the gods so that the stranded community can return home to our world.  The final boss battle is against the Transmuter, a powerful wizard responsible for creating monsters such as Medusa, Chimera and the Minotaur and who is the one who opened the rift to the world of myths and trapped the people here.</p>
        <p>There is melee and ranged combat, and also magic.  Future games will also include a potion brewing mechanic.</p>
        <p>I was inspired by games where you could explore, gather resources and craft your own equipment.  I was also inspired by games where you could interact with deities or demons and do quests for them.  I think I've finally hit on the concept that succesfully combines the two.</p>
