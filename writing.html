        <h3>Current Project:</h3>
        <P>A contemporary fantasy series featuring five characters with extraordinary powers struggling to find their place in the world and fighting against various tyrannical, cruel, manipulative or supernatural enemies.</P>
        <h3>The heroes: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A depressed alcoholic chosen by the pagan gods and wielding powers of the elements</li>
            <li>A survivor of emotional and mental abuse, who accidentally consumes a holy relic and gains the power of healing</li>
            <li>A non-binary trans woman who can shapeshift into any form but whatever form she takes she always has the same scar</li>
            <li>A woman, another abuse survivor, who lost her sight but designed a cybernetic replacement for her eyes, only for them to malfunction and allow her to tap into a whole world's worth of knowledge and to see through lies</li>
            <li>An intelligent young woman who embraced Egyptian mythology in an attempt to connect with her african heritage and then goes on to learn ancient magical arts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The enemies they face range from abusers, bigots, religious hypocrites and capitalist overlords to more supernatural threats such as a powerful but emotionally damaged necromancer, demonic entities, ghosts, dragons and strange beings from a future universe actively working to speed up the collapse of our universe.</p>
        <p>Themes explored include sexuality, gender, spirituality, abuse, capitalism and the inevitability of our own mortality.</p>
